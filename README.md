## Overview

This open-source project aims to simplify the process of resolving and visualizing IP Addresses and their linked DNS values, aiding in cloud configuration debugging and offering an intuitive method to understand the relationships between IPs and domains.

## Key Features

- **IP and DNS Mapping:** Resolve and visualize IP Addresses and DNS values effortlessly.
- **Cloud Debugging:** Accelerate the process of identifying server locations, webserver details, etc.
- **Visual Representation:** Mermaid.js powered graphs for a clear visual representation of connections.
- **Geolocation Integration:** Enrich the visualization by mapping IP Addresses to physical locations, enhancing geographic data representation.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of changes in IP-DNS mappings with alerts or notifications for alterations.

## Current Features

The tool currently offers the following functionality:

- **Domain/Sub-Domain Resolution:** Accepts user-provided lists of domains/sub-domains, processes them, and visualizes the data using Mermaid.js.

## Planned Features

The roadmap for future enhancements includes:

- **Reverse Lookup:** Processing and visualization of lists of IP Addresses.
- **Combined Analysis:** Accepting both IP Addresses and domains/sub-domains for comprehensive analysis.
- **Export Options:** Generating PDF or image exports of visualizations.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Adding click functionality in Mermaid.js graphs for detailed information on nodes (IP or domain).
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Storing and analyzing historical mapping data to identify trends and anomalies over time.

## Usage

1. **Provide a list of domains/sub-domains** through the provided UI.
2. **Visualize the IP and DNS mappings** using the generated Mermaid.js graphs.
